# Project8InventoryApp1
starter code for database app as part of udacity course
Project Overview
You're almost at the finish line! This project is the first part of a 2 stage project where you'll create a single amazing app that will pull together many of the components you've learned in this Nanodegree program!

In this project, you'll design and create the structure of a Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

We will split the development of this app in two stages. Let's talk about Stage 1.

In this stage you’ll focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database. Note: This stage of the project will not have any UI components

Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about data storage in Android, using both SQLite tables and file storage on the device. These skills let you build apps which are critical to small businesses worldwide. By practicing these skills and building this app, you will have the foundation to build similar apps for any kind of business.

What will I Iearn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Creating a SQLite table in your app
Populating that table with new entries
Modifying the entries
Displaying the contents of the table to users.
Note: As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted. Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted.
